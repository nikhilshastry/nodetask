# nodetask
nodejs task for appiness interactive

Node application is run on port 4000
I have created two collections 'users' and 'user_roles' in localhost mongo db named 'nodetask'
I have used node package 'joi' for validations of the user fields
Please find screenshots of the mongoshell (used to insert users) and testing the application on Postman
Use the URL : "http://localhost:4000/api/users" to test it
